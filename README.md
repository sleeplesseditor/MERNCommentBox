# MERN Comment Box

A simple MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node) comment box application. MLab is used for remote MongoDB connection. Built following the FreeCodeCamp guide [here](https://medium.com/@bryantheastronaut/react-getting-started-the-mern-stack-tutorial-feat-es6-de1a2886be50).

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

The app still requires some testing and minor alterations, but is available for browsing.

To get the app up and running, follow these steps: 

1) cd MERNCommentBox
2) npm install
3) npm run start-dev
